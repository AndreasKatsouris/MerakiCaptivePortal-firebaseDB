# Food Cost Management Module - Comprehensive Documentation

**Version:** 2.1.2-2025-05-15  
**Author:** Laki Sparks Development Team

## Overview

The Food Cost Management module has been refactored from a monolithic structure to a modular architecture for improved:
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Scalability
- Code organization

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the module structure, functionality, and usage.

## Latest Update: Enhanced Order Calculation (v2.1.2)

We've implemented significant improvements to the order calculation system with two key enhancements:

### 1. Terminology Update: "Covering Days"
- Renamed "lead time" to "covering days" throughout the system
- This better reflects the purpose of this parameter: the number of days the new order is intended to cover
- Maintains compatibility with existing configurations through backward compatibility support

### 2. Intelligent Critical Item Identification
- Implemented a sophisticated multi-factor criticality scoring system (0-100)
- Algorithm blends three approaches:
  - **Category-Based:** Automatically flags items in critical categories like Fresh Produce, Protein, Dairy, etc.
  - **Manual Designation:** Preserves existing manual critical item flags
  - **Risk Scoring:** Calculates criticality based on usage volatility (40%), stock level (30%), and supplier reliability (30%)
- Items scoring above threshold (default: 70) are automatically marked as critical
- Full transparency with detailed scoring breakdown for each factor
- Visual indicators maintained (yellow highlighting, warning badge)

## Upcoming Update: Editable Stock Data

We're adding robust functionality to edit stock data directly within the application. This enhancement will allow administrators to correct errors or update stock data without having to re-upload CSV files.

### Implementation Plan

### Technical Architecture

The Advanced Purchase Order system will follow these architectural principles:

1. **Modularity**: Standalone service with clear interfaces
2. **Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality with opt-in advanced features
3. **Performance**: Efficient queries and caching to minimize latency
4. **Testability**: Comprehensive test suite for all new components
5. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of algorithms and calculation methods

### Data Flow

1. User opens PO modal and toggles "Advanced" calculation
2. System queries historical data via `historical-usage-service.js`
3. Statistical metrics are calculated for each item
4. Enhanced parameters are passed to the existing order calculation algorithm
5. Results are displayed with additional context about historical trends

### Configuration Parameters

The system will support these configurable parameters:

- **Look-back Period**: How far back to analyze (7/14/30 days, default: 14)
- **Volatility Multiplier**: Weight given to usage volatility in safety stock (default: 1.0)
- **Trend Factor**: How much to adjust for increasing/decreasing trends (default: 0.5)
- **Minimum History Required**: Minimum days of history needed (default: 7)
- **Fallback Behavior**: What to do when insufficient history exists (default: use basic calculation)

### Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter issues with the Advanced Purchase Order system, use this guide to diagnose and resolve common problems.

#### Testing the Historical Data Service

A test harness is provided to validate the historical data service functionality:

1. Open `/js/modules/food-cost/tests/historical-service-test.html` in your browser
2. Add your store name(s) and item code(s) to test
3. Click "Run All Tests" to validate:
   - Data retrieval from Firebase
   - Statistical calculations
   - Caching performance

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **No Historical Data Found**
   - **Symptom**: The advanced PO shows "No historical data" in the calculation details
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - No previous stock usage records for this store
     - Store name mismatch between current context and historical records
     - Firebase permissions issue
   - **Solutions**:
     - Verify store name is consistent across all records
     - Check that at least one stock usage record exists for this store
     - Validate Firebase database access and rules

2. **Historical Data Not Being Used**
   - **Symptom**: Orders look the same in both basic and advanced modes
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Insufficient historical data points (default minimum: 5)
     - Item codes don't match between current and historical data
   - **Solutions**:
     - Ensure consistent item coding across all records
     - Increase the number of historical records by saving more stock usage data
     - Reduce the minimum required data points in the code if needed

3. **Unexpected Order Quantities**
   - **Symptom**: Advanced calculation suggests unusual quantities
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Outliers in historical data causing volatility
     - Day-of-week patterns causing seasonal adjustments
   - **Solutions**:
     - Review the historical insights in the item details view
     - Adjust volatility multiplier parameter (default: 1.0)
     - Temporarily switch to basic calculation if needed

4. **Performance Issues**
   - **Symptom**: Advanced PO generation is slow
   - **Possible Causes**:
     - Large number of historical records being processed
     - Inefficient Firebase queries
     - Caching not working properly
   - **Solutions**:
     - Reduce lookback period (7 days instead of 30)
     - Check network performance
     - Clear the service cache and try again

#### Firebase Database Requirements

The historical usage service requires the following Firebase Realtime Database structure:

```
stockUsage/
  {dateTime_key}/
    timestamp: number
    storeName: string
    stockItems: {
      {itemCode}: {
        itemCode: string
        usage: number
        usagePerDay: number
        ...
      }
    }
```

For optimal performance, add the following indexes to your Firebase rules:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "stockUsage": {
      ".indexOn": ["timestamp", "storeName"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Recent Updates

## Key Purchasing Concepts

### Re-order Point
The re-order point is a critical concept in the purchase order system. It represents the theoretical stock level at the time of your next delivery date. It is calculated as:

`Re-order Point = Current Stock - (Usage/Day Ã— Days to Next Delivery)`

This is NOT the level at which reordering is triggered. Rather, it's used to determine how much to order:

`Order Quantity = Required Stock - Re-order Point`

Where:
- **Required Stock**: The total amount needed for the forecast period, including base usage, safety stock, and critical buffer
- **Re-order Point**: The projected remaining stock at the next delivery date

The Advanced Purchase Order system enhances these calculations by using historical usage patterns to better predict future needs.

#### Reorder Formula

The purchase order system uses an advanced formula to calculate optimal order quantities. The formula takes into account multiple factors:

1. **Base Forecast Usage**:
   ```
   baseUsage = usagePerDay Ã— forecastPeriod
   forecastPeriod = daysToNextDelivery + leadTimeDays
   ```

2. **Safety Stock Calculation**:
   ```
   safetyStock = baseUsage Ã— (safetyStockPercentage / 100)
   forecastWithSafety = baseUsage + safetyStock
   ```

3. **Critical Item Buffer** (if applicable):
   ```
   criticalBuffer = forecastWithSafety Ã— (criticalItemBuffer / 100)
   finalForecast = forecastWithSafety + criticalBuffer
   ```

4. **Order Quantity Calculation**:
   ```
   requiredStock = finalForecast
   orderQuantity = max(0, requiredStock - currentStock)
   ```

5. **Advanced Considerations**:
   - Historical usage volatility analysis for high-variance items
   - Unit cost considerations for high-value items
   - Supplier constraints and minimum order quantities
   - Seasonal adjustments (when applicable)

The order quantities are then rounded appropriately for each item's unit of measure and organized by supplier and category in the final purchase order.
