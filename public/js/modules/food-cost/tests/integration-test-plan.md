# Food Cost Module Integration Test Plan

**Version: 1.9.4-2025-04-19**

## Overview

This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the refactored Food Cost module. With all component tests now passing, we need to verify that these components work correctly together in the full application context.

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Test Database**: Use a Firebase test instance with pre-populated data
2. **Browser Support**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
3. **Mock Data**: Prepare sample CSV files with various data formats
4. **Network Conditions**: Test under normal and throttled network conditions

## Integration Test Scenarios

### 1. Component Communication

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Filter Synchronization | Verify CategoryFilter and CostCenterFilter synchronize | Selected filters should be reflected in both components |
| Table Updates | Change filters and verify StockDataTable updates | Table should only show items matching selected filters |
| DataSummary Updates | Change filtered data and verify summary recalculates | Summary values should update automatically |

### 2. Database Operations

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Load Data | Test initial data loading from Firebase | Data should display correctly in all components |
| Save Stock Usage | Save stock usage data and verify persistence | Data should be saved in correct Firebase format |
| Error Handling | Test behavior when Firebase is unavailable | Should display appropriate error messages |

### 3. CSV Processing

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Import CSV | Import CSV with various formats | Should correctly map headers and process data |
| Large File Handling | Test with 1000+ line CSV file | Should handle large datasets efficiently |
| Invalid Data | Test with malformed CSV data | Should provide helpful error messages |

### 4. Critical Business Logic

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Reorder Point Calculation | Test reorder point calculation with various inputs | Should highlight items below reorder point |
| Usage Per Day | Verify usage per day calculation | Should match (opening + purchase - closing) รท stock period days |
| Total Cost Summary | Test calculation of total cost across various filters | Should match sum of filtered items |

### 5. UI Interactions

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Responsive Layout | Test on different screen sizes | Layout should adapt appropriately |
| Sort Functionality | Test sorting data by different columns | Data should sort correctly |
| Search Filtering | Test search functionality with various terms | Should filter to matching items only |
| Print/Export | Test print and export functionality | Should generate correct output |

## Testing Process

1. Execute all component tests to verify they pass in isolation
2. Run integration tests focusing on component communication
3. Test database operations using the Firebase test environment
4. Validate end-to-end workflows with realistic user scenarios
5. Document any issues or inconsistencies for further refinement

## Success Criteria

The integration testing phase is considered complete when:

1. All individual component tests pass consistently
2. All integrated components function correctly together
3. Database operations follow established patterns from the existing codebase
4. All core business logic is preserved and functioning correctly
5. The UI remains consistent and responsive under all test conditions

## Next Steps After Integration Testing

1. Finalize documentation including updated architecture diagrams
2. Prepare for production deployment with incremental rollout plan
3. Outline Phase 5 (Optimization and Refinement) with focus areas
4. Create monitoring strategy for post-refactoring performance

## Test Reporting

Document test results in the following format:

```
Test Case: [Name]
Date: [Date]
Tester: [Name]
Result: [Pass/Fail]
Notes: [Any observations or issues]
```

Maintain a central test log to track overall progress and outstanding issues.
