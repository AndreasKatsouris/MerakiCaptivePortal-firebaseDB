- [ ] System design patterns
- [ ] API contract definitions
- [ ] Performance optimization strategies

### BACK Agent
- [ ] Firebase Functions development
- [ ] Database schema design
- [ ] Third-party API integrations
- [ ] Authentication/authorization systems

### FRONT Agent
- [ ] Vue.js 3 framework mastery
- [ ] Progressive Web App development
- [ ] Bootstrap 5 styling
- [ ] ES6 module architecture

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Infrastructure management

### QA Agent
- [ ] Testing strategy development
- [ ] Automated testing frameworks
- [ ] Quality assurance protocols
- [ ] Bug tracking and resolution

### SEC Agent
- [ ] Firebase security rules

## Activation Commands

### Agent Self-Check
```bash
# Verify agent readiness
npm run agent-check --agent=[AGENT_ID]

# Validate environment setup
npm run env-validate --platform=firebase

# Test communication protocol
npm run comm-test --target=comms.md
```

### Platform Integration Test
```javascript
// Test platform access
const platformAccess = await validatePlatformAccess();
console.log('Platform Access:', platformAccess);

// Test Firebase connectivity
const firebaseStatus = await testFirebaseConnection();
console.log('Firebase Status:', firebaseStatus);
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Agent Failure Recovery
1. **Immediate Notification**: Alert COORD agent
2. **Backup Assignment**: Reassign critical tasks
3. **Recovery Attempt**: Restart agent with diagnostics
4. **Escalation**: Manual intervention if required

### Communication Breakdown
1. **Fallback Protocol**: Use alternative communication channel
2. **Status Broadcast**: All agents report current status
3. **Coordination Restore**: Re-establish central coordination
4. **Task Continuity**: Resume work with updated assignments

## Performance Monitoring

### Agent Health Metrics
- Task completion rate
- Response time to communications
- Code quality metrics
- Error frequency

### System Integration Metrics
- Inter-agent collaboration efficiency
- Task handoff success rate
- Conflict resolution time
- Overall project velocity
